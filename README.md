# Introduction

This lesson is all about the Robot Operating System or ROS for short. ROS is widely used across the industry and academia for building robotics applications. ROS is an Open Source Robotics framework that provides libraries and tools for working with hardware and for passing messages between components. ROS also has tools for visualization, simulation and analysis as well as extensive community support and an interface to numerous powerful software libraries. 

# Brief History of ROS

Development of ROS began in the mid-2000s as Project Switchyard in Stanford's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. In 2007, ROS became a formal entity with support from Willow Garage. Since 2013, the Open Source Robotics Foundation has been maintaining and developing ROS.
